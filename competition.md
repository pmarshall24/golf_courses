# Competition

Competitive golf is an opportunity to see how you stack up against your fellow players. These opportunities come in the form of casual matches, like *Men's Night at Cap*, or in more formal competitions like the BC Seniors Championship or the BC Men's Amateur Championship. Over the years, Mike has challenged himself in many different types of golf competition. This page lays out a few of his personal highlights.

**1. 2008 Capilano Senior Men's Championship**

This come-from-behind win was perhaps most memorable for the prize - a round of golf at Capilano with Master's Champion Mike Weir. It was also the first of 4 Capilano Senior Championships.

**2. Vancouver & District Senior Championship**

Another come-from-behind win in a regional golf competition. This championship was previously won by BC amateur legend, Doug Roxburgh. 

**3. Utter Domination in Capilano's Greensome Championship**

The duo of Mike Marshall and Peter Therrien were virtually unbeatable for a time in the *Greensome* with six wins in ten years.
