# Holes-in-One

Shooting a hole-in-one is no easy feat. The [National Hole-In-One Registry](https://www.nationalholeinoneregistry.com/facts-and-feats/#:~:text=1%20There%20are%20approximately%20over%20500%20million%20rounds,a%20hole%20in%20one%20is%201%3A3500%20More%20items) states that the odds of scoring a hole-in-one are only 1:3500. Other sources say a scratch golfer will shoot a hole-in-one once every 7 years (or around 800 rounds) on average. However you slice it, scoring a hole-in-one comes down to luck.

Mike's golf career started in 1962, but he would have to wait more than thirty years to score his first hole-in-one. This finally happened on April 11, 1999 on the 11th hole at Capilano while playing with all three of his sons. Cap's 11th hole would two additional aces, one of which was on the alternate green. Another hole-in-one came during the winter on Cap's 4th hole. There was basically no chance at a hole-in-one unless it was a relatively short par 3 over water. El Camaleon Mayakoba, in Mexico, was also the scene of one of Mike's five holes-in-one.
