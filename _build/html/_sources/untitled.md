# Low Scores

These two golf courses are not standouts for their location, design, or difficulty, but for the score shot. Both are championship courses

```{dropdown} 1. Mountain Brook Golf Club
Located in Gold Canyon, Arizona. 
"This was a pretty course. It would be unremarkable except for the remarkable score I achieved. Even included a 3-putt on the second hole! Everything else went in. Course itself is a pleasant resort course and (obviously) not overly challenging."

```{dropdown} 2. Stoneridge Golf Club
Located in Blanchard, Idaho.
"Nice little small time resort. Quite a good course, but mostly memorable for my score. Tied the course record, but I probably had the tie breaker, as they have a 19th hole (a 240 yard par 4 to a hidden green). I made a 2!"

```{dropdown} 3. St. Mellion Golf Club -- Kernow
[Royal County Down Golf Club](https://www.royalcountydown.org/) is located in Newcastle, Northern Ireland. This may be Mike's all-time favorite course, and Cypress Point is only ranked higher because of how hard it is to get to play it. Royal County Down is the reigning world's number one golf course in the [Golf Digest World's 100 Greatest Courses](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/worlds-100-greatest-golf-courses) rankings. This is certainly a dream course for any golf enthusiast.
