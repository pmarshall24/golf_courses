# Low Scores

These two golf courses are not standouts for their location, setting, design, or difficulty, but for the low scores. These are both championship length courses. Lower scores were shot on executive 18-hole golf courses, but these have been weeded out. 

```{admonition} Special Mention: Capilano G&CC
Mike shot 65 at Cap on more than one occasion, including shooting two strokes lower than his age at 67.

```{dropdown} 1. Mountain Brook Golf Club, Gold Canyon, Arizona
 
"This was a pretty course. It would be unremarkable except for the remarkable score I achieved. Even included a 3-putt on the second hole! Everything else went in. Course itself is a pleasant resort course and (obviously) not overly challenging."

```{dropdown} 2. Stoneridge Golf Club, Blanchard, Idaho

"Nice little small time resort. Quite a good course, but mostly memorable for my score. Tied the course record, but I probably had the tie breaker, as they have a 19th hole (a 240 yard par 4 to a hidden green). I made a 2!"
