# Acknowledgments

This a small section to mention some of Mike's supporters and playing partners over the years. These are the primary people who joined Mike in playing some of these 1028 different golf courses. 

## The Number 1 Supporter

No married person would be able to play over 1000 golf courses and remain married without a very supportive partner. Jane married a golf fanatic, so she knew what she was getting into (at least to some degree). She not only supported this passion but she accompanied him on many golf holidays and played many, many rounds of golf with him. Mike considers his golf trips and rounds with Jane to be "the best ones!" 

## A Chance to Teach the Game

Perhaps one of the highlights of his golf career may have been the time spent on the course with family. Mike was able to teach the game of golf (and a variety of swear words) to his kids. This included many summer evenings at Capilano (usually a second round of the day), and many holiday rounds in the Okanagan and other areas. Bob would take what he learned to become the Capilano Junior Boys Champion, beating out the recently crowned Men's Club Champion. Tom would be known for his booming drives. And Pete was best known for exploring the surrounding forests while others played the actual course. It must have been nice to be seen as the best golfer in the world by his young kids.
