# The Best Courses Played

This page highlights Mike's personal favorite golf courses. The top 4 are absolute standouts, but there are a number of courses that could have claimed the fifth spot. Sunningdale Old and New were selected, and the other favorites are mentioned in the tier two section below. Capilano Golf and Country Club gets it's own page because of the personal history here. 

## The Top Five

```{dropdown} 1. Cypress Point Golf Club
Cypress Point GC is a ultra-private club located on the Monterey Peninsula in California. It's surrounded by other great courses like Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill, but it's much harder to get a ticket to play here. Cypress Point is consistently rated in the top 5 courses in America, and was rated third in [*Golf Digest's* 2023 rankings](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/americas-100-greatest-golf-courses-ranking). This round was a very memorable Father's Day present from Bob (or Millie), who was lucky enough to play with him. Amazingly, Millie was able to set up this round after striking up a conversation with a club member on a flight.

```{dropdown} 3. Royal County Down Golf Club
[Royal County Down Golf Club](https://www.royalcountydown.org/) is located in Newcastle, Northern Ireland. This may be Mike's all-time favorite course, and Cypress Point is only ranked higher because of how hard it is to get to play it. Royal County Down is the reigning world's number one golf course in the [Golf Digest World's 100 Greatest Courses](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/worlds-100-greatest-golf-courses) rankings. This is certainly a dream course for any golf enthusiast.
