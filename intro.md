# Watershed Monitoring Program Guide

The *Watershed Monitoring Program Guide* is a comprehensive guide to the hydro-meteorological monitoring program operated by the Water Services Watersheds and Environment group (W&E). This network consists of numerous monitoring stations in the Capilano, Seymour, and Coquitlam water supply areas, both upstream and downstream of the primary drinking water reservoirs. This includes hydrometric stations, fire weather stations, snow-hydrology stations, water quality stations, and remote cameras. This resource is intended to assist monitoring field staff and management in operating the watershed monitoring program. 

Monitoring has been conducted in Metro Vancouver’s water supply areas since at least the early 1900’s. Capilano River above Lakehead (WSC 08GA010) has a continuous data record beginning in 1914. Metro Vancouver also has one of the oldest snow survey programs in Canada. Snow surveys were conducted in parts of the WSA’s as early as 1910. 

Monitoring environmental conditions is essential to understanding current conditions, as well as natural and human-caused changes over time. Data collected helps support weather and streamflow forecasting, operational decision-making, and water resource planning. Work restrictions and watershed travel restrictions are implemented based on certain weather parameters. In addition, internal and external groups use these data for planning, research, and climate-related studies.

There are sections covering the following topics:

- Program mission, goals, and objectives
- Responsibilities
- Training requirements
- Safety
- Standards
- Station characteristics
- Sensors specifications
- Maintenance and calibration
- Snow monitoring program
- Data management
- Reports and data visualization

The *Watershed Monitoring Program Guide* is updated and maintained by W&E monitoring program staff. Questions about this resource or the Watershed Monitoring Program can be directed to Peter Marshall (Contact: [Peter.Marshall@metrovancouver.org](mailto:Peter.Marshall@metrovancouver.org)).
